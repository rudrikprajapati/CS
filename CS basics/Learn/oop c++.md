# OOP in C++

### what is oop?
```
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform 
operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating 
objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute 
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs 
- OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug 
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
```

### C++ oop

**class and object**
```
A class is like a blueprint of data member and functions and object is an 
instance of class. For example, lets say we have a class Car which has data 
members (variables) such as speed, weight, price and functions such as 
gearChange(), slowDown(), brake() etc. Now lets say I create a object of this 
class named FordFigo which uses these data members and functions and give them 
its own values. Similarly we can create as many objects as we want using the 
blueprint(class).
```
```cpp
class Box {
public:
        double length;   // Length of a box
        double breadth;  // Breadth of a box
        double height;   // Height of a box
};
```

**constructor**
```
Constructor is a special member function of a class that initializes the object
of the class. Constructor name is same as class name and it doesn’t have a 
return type. Lets take a simple example to understand the working of 
constructor.

- Constructor vs Member function
1) Constructor doesn’t have a return type. Member function has a return type.
2) Constructor is automatically called when we create the object of the class. 
Member function needs to be called explicitly using object of class.
3) When we do not create any constructor in our class, C++ compiler generates a 
default constructor and insert it into our code. The same does not apply to 
member functions.
```

**destructor**
```
A destructor is a special member function that works just opposite to 
constructor, unlike constructors that are used for initializing an object, 
destructors destroy (or delete) the object.
```
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class a {
public:
    a() {
        cout << "constructor" << endl;
    }
    ~a() {
        cout << "destructor" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    a obj;
    return 0;
}
```
```
Destructor rules
1) Name should begin with tilde sign(~) and must match class name.
2) There cannot be more than one destructor in a class.
3) Unlike constructors that can have parameters, destructors do not allow any parameter.
4) They do not have any return type, just like constructors.
5) When you do not specify any destructor in a class, compiler generates a 
default destructor and inserts it into your code.
```

**access specifiers**
```
In C++, there are three access specifiers:

public - members are accessible from outside the class
private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they 
can be accessed in inherited classes. You will learn more about Inheritance later.
```
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm

### Encapsulation
```
Encapsulation is a process of combining data and function into a single unit 
like capsule. This is to avoid the access of private data members from outside 
the class. To achieve encapsulation, we make all data members of class private 
and create public functions, using them we can get the values from these data 
members or set the value to these data members.
```
example
```
The most commonly used example is the medical capsule. This capsule mixes few types of medicines and stored in one capsule.

A car is having multiple parts, like steering, wheels, engine etc. which binds together to form a single object 
that is car. So, Here multiple parts of cars encapsulates itself together to form a single object that is Car.

In real time we are using Encapsulation for security purpose.
Encapsulation = Abstraction + Data Hiding.
```
```cpp
class point
{
private:
    int x, y;
public:
    int getX() const {
        return x;
    }
    void setX(int _x) {
        x = _x;
    }
    // ...
};
```

### Inheritance
```
Inheritance is a feature using which an object of child class acquires the 
properties of parent class.
```
example
```
let's assume that there is a class as Vehicle. All vehicles are not the same. We can inherit common properties 
like color, size, type from the parent vehicle class and create classes like Car, Bus, Bike.

Mobile
- samsung
- apple
- vivo
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Shape {
public:
    void setWidth(int w) {
        width = w;
    }
    void setHeight(int h) {
        height = h;
    }
protected:
    int width;
    int height;
};

// Derived class
class Rectangle: public Shape {
public:
    int getArea() { 
        return (width * height); 
    }
};

int main(void) {
     Rectangle Rect;
     Rect.setWidth(5);
     Rect.setHeight(7);
     cout << "Total area: " << Rect.getArea() << endl;
     return 0;
}
```
```
When deriving a class from a base class, the base class may be inherited 
through public, protected or private inheritance. The type of inheritance is 
specified by the access-specifier as explained above.

We hardly use protected or private inheritance, but public inheritance is 
commonly used. While using different type of inheritance, following rules are 
applied −

Public Inheritance − When deriving a class from a public base class, public 
members of the base class become public members of the derived class and 
protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived 
class. A base class's private members are never accessible directly from a 
derived class, but can be accessed through calls to the public and protected 
members of the base class.

Protected Inheritance − When deriving from a protected base class, public and 
protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived 
class.

Private Inheritance − When deriving from a private base class, public and 
protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class.
```

**Types of Inheritance in C++**
```
1) Single inheritance
In Single inheritance one class inherits one class exactly.

B inherits A

        A
        |
        B

2) Multilevel inheritance
In this type of inheritance one class inherits another child class.

C inherits B and B inherits A
        
        A
        |
        B
        |
        C

3) Multiple inheritance
In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit more than one class. This means 
that in this type of inheritance a single child class can have multiple parent 
classes.

C inherits A and B both

        A    B
        |    |
        ______
          |
          C
          
Not possible in Java (possible with Interfaces because in interface we must have to override methods, so no ambiguity)
in C++ we have to specify scope, A::fun() or B::fun() in C class

4) Hierarchical inheritance
In this type of inheritance, one parent class has more than one child class.

Class B and C inherits class A

            A
            |
         ______
        |      |
        B      C

5) Hybrid inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. For 
example, A child and parent class relationship that follows multiple and 
hierarchical inheritance both can be called hybrid inheritance.

### Polymorphism
```
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that 
are related to each other by inheritance.

Function overloading and Operator overloading are examples of polymorphism. 
Polymorphism is a feature using which an object behaves differently in 
different situation.
In function overloading we can have more than one function with same name but 
different numbers, type or sequence of arguments.

2 types:
1) Compile time (early binding) - function overloading
2) Runtime (late binding) - function overriding using virtual function
```
example
```
We can take a boy as a real-world example. This boy can be a student, a player, and a writer. 
So that this boy can exist in different ways in different situations.

A software engineer can perform different task at different instance of time depending on the task assigned  to 
him .He can done coding , testing , analysis and designing depending on the task assign and the requirement.

Consider the stadium of common wealth games. Single stadium but it perform multiple task like swimming, lawn 
tennis etc.

If a girl is married and mother of 2 children doing teaching job then  she is a women first, teacher in a school 
when she is in school, wife of someone at home, mother of her children, and obvious daughter of someone & may be 
girl friend of someone (just kidding) means a woman plays diffent roles at different times dats the polymorphism 
(many forms).
```
```cpp
// compile time - function overloading
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Add {
 public:
  int sum(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
  }
  int sum(int num1, int num2, int num3) {
    return num1 + num2 + num3;
  }
};
int main() {
  Add obj;
  //This will call the first function
  cout << "Output: " << obj.sum(10, 20) << endl;
  //This will call the second function
  cout << "Output: " << obj.sum(11, 22, 33);
  return 0;
}
```
```cpp
// compile time - function overriding
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A {
 public:
  void disp() {
    cout << "Super Class Function" << endl;
  }
};
class B: public A {
 public:
  void disp() {
    cout << "Sub Class Function";
  }
};
int main() {
  A obj;
  obj.disp(); // Super Class Function

  B obj2;
  obj2.disp(); // Sub Class Function
  return 0;
}
```

```cpp
// runtime - virtual function
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
//Parent class or super class or base class
class Animal {
 public:
  virtual void animalSound() {
    cout << "This is a generic Function";
  }
};
//child class or sub class or derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
 public:
  void animalSound() {
    cout << "Woof";
  }
};
int main() {
  Animal* obj;
  obj = new Dog();
  obj -> animalSound(); // "woof"
  // without virtual keyword output is "This is a generic Function"
  return 0;
}
```

### pure virtual function
It is possible that you want to include a virtual function in a base class so that it may be redefined in a derived class to suit the objects of that class, but that there is no meaningful definition you could give for the function in the base class
```
virtual void function() = 0; 
```
The = 0 tells the compiler that the function has no body and above virtual function will be called pure virtual function.

### Virtual Function
A virtual function is a function in a base class that is declared using the keyword virtual. Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, signals to the compiler that we don't want static linkage for this function.

What we do want is the selection of the function to be called at any given point in the program to be based on the kind of object for which it is called. This sort of operation is referred to as dynamic linkage, or late binding.

### Abstraction
```
Abstraction is a process of hiding irrelevant details from user. For example,
When you send an sms you just type the message, select the contact and click 
send, the phone shows you that the message has been sent, what actually happens 
in background when you click send is hidden from you as it is not relevant to 
you.

Rules of Abstract Class
1) As we have seen that any class that has a pure virtual function is an abstract class.
2) We cannot create the instance of abstract class.
3) We can create pointer and reference of base abstract class points to the 
instance of child class. For example, this is valid:

Animal *obj = new Dog();
obj -> sound();

4) Abstract class can have constructors.
5) If the derived class does not implement the pure virtual function of parent 
class then the derived class becomes abstract.
```

example
```
Tv Remote..
Remote is a interface between user and tv.. right. which has buttons like 0 to 10, on/off etc but we dont know 
circuits inside remote, User does not  need to know, Just he is using essential thing that is remote.

Let's take the ATM machine. In an ATM machine, we can perform functions like withdraw cash, deposit cash, check 
balance, print bills, and so on. Even though it performs a lot of actions it doesn’t show us the process. It has 
hidden its process by showing only the main things like getting inputs and giving the output.

The next example is the most commonly used mobile phones. On a mobile phone, we can perform so many actions like 
making a call, sending messages, take pictures, download software and etc. We perform a lot of things but here 
also we don't know the inside process of these things. Which means the implementation parts are hidden.
```

**OOPs have following features**
```
Object         - Instance of Class
Class          - Blue print of Object
Encapsulation  - Protecting our Data
Inheritence    - One property of object is acquiring to another property of object
Abstraction    - Hiding our irrelevant Data
Polymorphism   - Different behaviors at different instances
```
